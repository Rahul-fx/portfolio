        <div id="bio">
            <p>I am a digital matte painter and VFX artist with a broad understanding of basic graphic design and photography. My main forte lies in creating artificial environments for various products, still and motion pictures. I use my skills of lighting, compositing, layout and projection mapping, to create photo-realistic images to narrate my story.</p><br>
<p>My utmost interest in creating a surrealistic environment by adding artificial lighting, props, and terrains have increased my basic understanding of creating a matte painting. Thanks to my friends and teachers who always encouraged me to take photography as a hobby which helped me a lot to understand the functionality of exposure, lighting and camera lenses. And also working with RAW files. </p>
