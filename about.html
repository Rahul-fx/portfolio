        <div id="bio">
            <p>Passionate and self-driven Digital Matte Painter and Environment artist, with Graphic design and Photography background, recently
based in Montreal working for film. I have worked on amazing projects, where I applied my 2D / 2.5D / 3DDMP skills like modeling,
texturing, lighting, layout, projection mapping/set extensions and replacements in order to create photo-realistic and nice environments
narrating and supporting a story of the certain scene sequence.</p><br>
<p>I have a good understanding of digital matte painting techniques including digital painting, colour space, Photoshop file management
and layering and Bit depth, combining CG with dmp as well as generating terrains in Houdini, compositing and finalising the scene.
Thanks my previous experience with photography I have good understanding of exposure, light, camera lenses and its functionality,
working with RAW files and also creating photogrammetry.</p>
