                <h1>Tokyo City VFX</h1>
			<p>This composition piece was done by me when I was pursuing my VFX course from Arena Animation. It was a video clip of Tokyo city. My composition was mostly inspired by the environments from the movie Ghost in the Shell. I won first prize in the inter-institute competition called Creative Minds for this VFX clip. </p><a href="https://vimeo.com/359698470" target="_blank" class="hire_me">View Project</a>

		<p>This composition piece was also done by me when I was pursuing my course. The idea behind this matte painting was a concept my friends and I developed while we were fantasizing about the movie Lord of the Rings. It was my version of fan art for all my favorite medieval movies. </p>
